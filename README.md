# 4201_multiples
[![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.png?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)

## Overview
The 4201 module contains two buffered 1:3 multiples at a width of 4HP. It works with both audio and CV, draws minimal current and uses only readily available, run-of-the-mill components. Special LED indicator lights give visual feedback about polarity and intensity of any signal going through the module and serve as a simple oscilloscope.  

This is an open hardware project. The repository contains all design files as well as gerbers to order PCBs directly from a manufacturer like [PCBWay.com](https://pcbway.com/), who kindly supplied prototyping boards for the development of this module.

## How to build?

Upload the *.zip* in the `gerber_files/` folder to your PCB manufacturer's website to order.

An interactive html BOM is available in the `bom/` folder inside of the KiCad project. Just open it in a browser and tick off sourced/placed components.  
Also shows where on the board components should be placed.  

## Component availability / choices

No unobtainium in this project. All components should be easily sourced. All SMT devices on the board are SOIC or 12106 and can be easily handsoldered. (0805 or miniMELF / SOD-80 packages can be used as replacements.)
