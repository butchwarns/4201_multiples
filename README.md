# 4201_multiples
[![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.png?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)

## Overview
The 4201 module contains two buffered 1:3 multiples at a width of 4HP. It works with both audio and CV, draws minimal current and uses only readily available, run-of-the-mill components. Special LED indicator lights give visual feedback about polarity and intensity of any signal going through the module and serve as a simple oscilloscope.  

This is an open hardware project. The repository contains all design files as well as gerbers to order PCBs directly from a manufacturer like [PCBWay.com](https://pcbway.com/), who kindly supplied prototyping boards for the development of this module.

## How to build?

Upload the *.zip* in the `gerber_files/` folder to your PCB manufacturer's website to order.

An interactive html BOM is available in the `bom/` folder inside of the KiCad project. Just open it in a browser and tick off sourced/placed components.  
Also shows where on the board components should be placed.  

## Component availability / choices

No unobtainium in this project. All components should be easily sourced. All SMT devices on the board are SOIC or 12106 and can be easily handsoldered. (0805 or miniMELF / SOD-80 packages can be used as replacements.)

## Project status

The main branch of this repository holds the current tested version of the board. All potentially breaking changes will be done on the develop branch and the build will be tested before merging. Images in this README do not necessarily show the most recent version of the board, though all images will have version numbers in their title.
